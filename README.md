Objective was to find out which of the two between 'Budget' and 'Votes' had a significant influence over the 'Gross' revenue generated. Performed Data Wrangling, Data Munging by imputing Null Values, removing Outliers and finally checked for correlations between 'Budget and Gross' and 'Votes and Gross' in the form of a Heatmap.
